## 🔄 **Always Free (No Expiry)**

Some services are *always free* within certain limits:

* **AWS Lambda** (1M requests/month)
* **DynamoDB** (25 GB)
* **Glacier** (10 GB retrievals)
* **SNS** (1M notifications/month)

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

* You must add a **credit/debit card** to create an AWS account (₹2 will be deducted for verification).
* If you go **beyond free tier limits**, AWS will charge you.
* Good practice: set up a **Billing Alarm** in CloudWatch to get alerts if costs cross, say **\$5**.

---

💡 In INR terms:
Free tier itself = **₹0**, but once you cross limits → charges can quickly grow (example: running bigger EC2 instances or storing large data in S3).

---

👉 Do you want me to create a **step-by-step guide with screenshots** on how to:

1. Enable free tier,
2. Track usage,
3. Set billing alarms — so you never get surprise AWS bills?



------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Excellent that you’re asking this now ⚡ — many people end up with **unexpected AWS bills** because they don’t know the limits. Let me explain step by step:

---

## 💳 1. If you add a credit card, will AWS auto-charge?

✅ Yes.

* When you create an AWS account, you must add a **credit/debit card**.
* AWS will deduct a **small verification charge (\$1 or ₹2 in India)** which is refunded.
* If you cross **Free Tier limits**, AWS will **automatically charge your card** at the end of the billing cycle.

---

## 📊 2. How much can you run for free?

The **biggest free limits** (for 12 months) are:

* **EC2** → 750 hours/month = 1 t2.micro or t3.micro instance running 24/7.
* **RDS** → 750 hours/month = 1 small database instance.
* **S3** → 5 GB storage.
* **CloudFront** → 50 GB/month.
* **Lambda** → 1M requests (Always Free).

👉 If you launch more than this, or choose **bigger instances (e.g., t2.medium, m5.large)**, you’ll start paying.

---

## 🚨 3. What happens if a bill is generated and unpaid?

* AWS will **try to charge your card** automatically.
* If payment fails → they will **suspend your account**.
* If unpaid for a long time → the account can be **terminated** and resources deleted.
* AWS doesn’t allow you to “skip” bills and keep using resources.

---

## 🛡️ 4. How to **limit usage** to Free Tier only?

Here are safe practices:

### ✅ Step 1: Enable **Free Tier Usage Alerts**

* Go to **AWS Billing Console** → “Billing Preferences.”
* Tick **Receive Free Tier Usage Alerts** → enter email.
* AWS will warn you when you cross limits.

### ✅ Step 2: Set a **Billing Alarm** in CloudWatch

* Create an alarm at **\$1 or \$5**.
* You’ll get email/SMS if costs go above.
* Example: “Stop using EC2, you’re now billed \$2.”

### ✅ Step 3: Use **AWS Budgets → Hard Limit**

* In **AWS Budgets**, set a monthly limit (e.g., \$0 or \$5).
* You’ll get alerts if usage exceeds.
  ⚠️ AWS won’t stop services automatically — but you’ll know early.

### ✅ Step 4: Manually Track Usage

* Use **AWS Cost Explorer** to check daily charges.
* Shut down unused EC2/RDS instances.

---

## 🔒 5. Pro-Safety Trick (for learners)

* Create an **IAM User** (not root account).
* Assign only free-tier services.
* Use **AWS Sandbox accounts** (like qwiklabs or skillbuilder labs) if experimenting with expensive services.

---

👉 Short answer:

* Yes, card is auto-charged if you cross free tier.
* You can safely run **1 EC2 + 1 RDS + 5GB S3** within free limits.
* To avoid bills: **enable billing alarms + budgets + free tier alerts**.

---

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Good question 👍 Let me clarify how AWS billing works in the **Free Tier**:

### 🔹 1. Why automatic cut happens?

When you sign up for AWS, you **must add a valid debit/credit card** (for identity verification).

* If you only use services **within Free Tier limits**, you won’t be charged.
* If you **exceed Free Tier usage**, AWS automatically charges your card for the extra usage — there is no manual approval step.
  That’s why it feels like an *automatic cut*.

### 🔹 2. Can you stop automatic charges?

By default, **you cannot prevent AWS from charging** if you cross limits.
But you can **control and limit usage** using:

* **Budgets & Alerts**: Set a **\$0 spending budget** in AWS Billing → Budgets. You’ll get email/SMS alerts if usage exceeds.
* **Service Quotas**: Manually restrict usage (like limiting EC2 instance size/count).
* **IAM policies**: Create permissions that block launching paid services.
* **Close resources**: Stop/delete EC2, RDS, S3, etc. if not using.

### 🔹 3. What if you don’t pay AWS bill?

* AWS will keep your account in **“past due”** state.
* Services may get **suspended** until payment.
* If unpaid for long, account could be **terminated**, but outstanding bills remain linked to your card.
  So better to **pay small charges** if they occur, or dispute via AWS support if you think it was wrong.

---

👉 For **safe practice**:

* Use **only free tier eligible services**.
* Set a **\$0 budget with alerts**.
* Run only **1 small instance (t2.micro / t3.micro)** at a time.
* Regularly check **Billing Dashboard → Free Tier Usage**.
