why do we need source code management as a Devops Engineer?
Good question üëç As a **DevOps Engineer**, source code management (SCM) like **Git, GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket** is absolutely essential. Here are the main reasons, in clear points:

---

## üîë Why Source Code Management (SCM) is Needed in DevOps

1. **Collaboration**

   * Multiple developers can work on the same codebase without overwriting each other‚Äôs changes.
   * Branches help teams work in parallel (features, bug fixes, hotfixes).

2. **Version Control**

   * Every change is tracked with commit history.
   * You can roll back to a previous stable version if new code breaks.

3. **Traceability**

   * Each commit links to an issue, feature, or bug.
   * Easy to see *who changed what, when, and why*.

4. **Code Review & Quality**

   * Pull/Merge Requests allow peer review before merging code to main branches.
   * Helps maintain code standards and catch bugs early.

5. **Integration with CI/CD**

   * SCM integrates with Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Azure DevOps, etc.
   * Any code push can trigger automated build, test, and deployment pipelines.

6. **Branching Strategies**

   * GitFlow, GitHub Flow, Trunk-based development give structured workflows.
   * Ensures stable *production branches* while developers experiment safely.

7. **Disaster Recovery & Backup**

   * Code stored in remote repositories (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket) acts as a backup.
   * If local systems crash, code is still safe.

8. **Collaboration Beyond Code**

   * SCM also stores configuration files, scripts, Helm charts, Terraform templates.
   * This makes **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** and DevOps practices possible.

9. **Audit & Compliance**

   * Commit logs provide an audit trail for regulatory/compliance checks.
   * Required in industries like banking, healthcare, government.

10. **Faster Delivery**

* With branching + automation, teams can deliver features and fixes faster, reducing time-to-market.

üëâ In short: **SCM is the backbone of DevOps pipelines** ‚Äî without it, automation, collaboration, rollback, and CI/CD would be impossible.
