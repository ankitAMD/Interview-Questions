# 📘 Git Q\&A Collection

---

### 1. ❓ Can we create a file/directory using Git command or Git only tracks files?

✅ **Answer:**
Git itself does **not create files or directories**. It only **tracks versioning** of files.
👉 You create files normally (`echo`, `touch`, `mkdir`), then add and commit them with Git.

---

### 2. ❓ How to unstage a file after `git add`?

✅ **Answer:**

```sh
git reset HEAD <file>
```

* Removes the file from staging but keeps changes in working directory.

---

### 3. ❓ What does `HEAD` mean in Git?

✅ **Answer:**

* `HEAD` is a **pointer to the latest commit in the current branch**.
  Example:

```sh
git reset HEAD app.py
```

* Here, `HEAD` means *“reset app.py to match the last commit in current branch”*.

---

### 4. ❓ Difference between `git reset` and `git rm`?

✅ **Answer:**

* `git reset HEAD <file>` → **unstages** a file but keeps it in working dir.
* `git rm <file>` → **removes** the file from working dir *and stages the deletion*.

---

### 5. ❓ Command to print a file in Windows CMD?

✅ **Answer:**

```sh
type <filename>
```

Example:

```sh
type abc.txt
```

---

### 6. ❓ How to revert the last commit?

✅ **Answer:**

```sh
git revert HEAD
```

This creates a **new commit** that undoes changes from the last commit.

---

### 7. ❓ How to revert a commit before the last one (e.g. 2nd last)?

✅ **Answer:**

```sh
git revert <commit-hash>
```

Example:

```sh
git revert d4e5f6g
```

👉 Might create conflicts → fix → `git add <file>` → `git revert --continue`.

---

### 8. ❓ How to handle conflict when reverting?

✅ **Answer:**
Steps when you see *“unmerged files”*:

```sh
# Check conflicts
git status  

# Edit files and fix conflicts manually  

# Stage fixed files
git add <file>

# Continue revert
git revert --continue
```

Or:

* `git revert --abort` → cancel the revert
* `git revert --skip` → skip that commit

---

### 9. ❓ How to revert multiple commits at once?

✅ **Answer:**

```sh
git revert HEAD~2..HEAD
```

* Reverts last 2 commits.
* Each commit gets reverted one by one.

---

### 10. ❓ How to completely remove last 2 commits (instead of reverting)?

✅ **Answer:**

```sh
git reset --hard HEAD~2
```

⚠️ DANGEROUS → rewrites history, use only if commits aren’t pushed to remote.

---

### 11. ❓ Example log & revert confusion

Your `git log`:

```
b0037f6 (HEAD -> master) added one line more
7f21305 ADDED HELLO Command
90bbe25 Revert "Added hello command"
0b3d97c append the new Hello with existing
9835d0a Added hello command
5fe2166 deleted abc.txt
6711432 abc2.txt
6cd82ca abc.txt
```

* To **revert commit `b0037f6`** (last one):

  ```sh
  git revert b0037f6
  ```
* To **revert commit `7f21305`** (not last one):

  ```sh
  git revert 7f21305
  ```

  ⚠️ May cause conflicts → resolve, then `git revert --continue`.

---

### 12. ❓ How to see Git log in short format?

✅ **Answer:**

```sh
git log --oneline
```

Shows: `<hash> <commit message>`

---

### 13. ❓ How to stage resolved conflicts after revert?

✅ **Answer:**

```sh
git add <file>
git revert --continue
```
